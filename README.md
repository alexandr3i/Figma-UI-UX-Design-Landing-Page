## Overview

During my apprenticeship at **Webcase**, I designed and iterated a UI/UX project in **Figma**, focusing on **user flows, visual hierarchy, spacing systems, and component-based design**. The outcome is a set of screens and reusable components that can be implemented in **Webflow** with a responsive structure.

## What’s inside

- **Wireframes** (early layout exploration)
- **High-fidelity UI** (final screens)
- **Components / UI kit** (buttons, inputs, cards, nav, etc.)
- **Typography & color decisions**
- **Responsive considerations** (desktop/tablet/mobile variants if you have them)

## What I practiced / learned

- Grid, spacing system, alignment consistency
- Creating reusable components (Auto Layout, variants)
- Designing for Webflow constraints (structure-first thinking)
- Iteration based on feedback (apprenticeship loop)

## Tools

- Figma (Auto Layout, Components, Variants, Prototyping)
- Webflow (layout implementation, responsive adjustments)
